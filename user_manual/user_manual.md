### 1. Introduction

1.1 Overview

Socialise is a web application that allows users to create and join existing events,
with a goal of bringing people together.

The events can be created by any user and the details of the events are fully
customizable. This included location, date and time and amount of people the event
is meant for. The entire application is synced with a MySQL database to ensure
consistency across multiple users of the application. If a user creates an application,
all other users will be able to join this event, if that is what they desire.

The application has been designed to be intuitive, but there are relevant help options
offered when needed. They are also not intrusive, so when they are not needed, they
will not be in the way.
The application has a goal of being as good on all devices as possible. Its responsive
nature was a focus throughout the creation and testing of the application. When a
user switches between devices, this will be evident.


1.2 Disclaimer
Socialise is not responsible for any inappropriate names or event information that
may be offensive. Although there will be an effort to stop these from happening.

Any damage done to devices while using Socialise is not Socialise’s liability. The
application was extensively tested throughout development and no harm was done to
any test machine.

### 2. App System

2.1 Layout
The user will start at the welcome screen. They will be able to create an account, log
in or use the forgot password function. Once the user manages to log in they will be
greeted by the map interface. This is the homepage.

The navigation bar will change and adapt to the page that the user is currently on. On
the homepage you have links to my profile, my events and a help function if needed.
On the events page you have events settings and on the profile page you have
profile settings.

The user will be able to view all their events from the my-events page and also on a
more condensed version of the profile page.


The layout of the system will be discussed in great detail below, taking the user
step-by-step through the entire system and any use case they may have.

2.2 Key Features

The main features of socialise is to create and join events. These events can involve
anything from a football match to a swimming lesson. The goal is to get people
involved in more activities then they normally would. The key feature is being a
powerful, single place to get people together and make friends. The simple UI
removes the barriers between the user and the event being organised and taking
place.

The map is a key feature. It archives its intention to display where surrounding events
are in relation to your current location. This means the user is not just reading a long
list of place names they never heard of. This app is ideal for people who may not be
familiar with their surrounding area.

The goal is to ensure events that are organized, take place due to a sufficient amount
of attendees. This only happens if they events are easily accessible, which is a major
feature of socialise.
